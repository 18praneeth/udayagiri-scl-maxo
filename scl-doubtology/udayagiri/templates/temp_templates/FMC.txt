"No Force Majeure Clause": 
This is a common clause in contracts which essentially frees both parties from liability or obligation when an extraordinary event or circumstance 
beyond the control of the parties, such as cybercrime, data breach or any such event described by the legal term, 
prevents one or both parties from fulfilling their obligations under the contract. 
Force majeure in any given situation is controlled by the law governing the contract, rather than general concepts of force majeure. 
The law of the contract often specified by a choice of law clause in the agreement, and if not is decided by a statute or principles of general law which apply to the contract. 
The first step to assess whether - and how - force majeure applies to any particular contract is to ascertain the law of our team which governs the contract.
