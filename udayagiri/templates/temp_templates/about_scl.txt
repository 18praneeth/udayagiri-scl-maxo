About SCL:

Sushiksha Coding League is nothing but a Coding School Initiative with a difference. 
The Coding School thought was infact ignited by Shri T V Mohandas Pai from the Prerna Stage in 2020. 
The Alumni took it forward and brought a cool quotient to the brand with a feel of cricketing spirit. The Tagline of SCL is “Anybody Can Code”
 – it means a great coder can come from any corner of the world.
SCL is spread across Six weeks into Two Phases. The SCL Mini, a short duration phase as the name suggests, with a couple of Workshops in Python,
Web development and Flask followed by a Sandbox Hackathon. This is just to make sure all the teams and participants are thorough with the basics of programming. 
This project is a part of the SCL Maxo where the teams develop a solution for a problem, applying technology to solve real life problems!
